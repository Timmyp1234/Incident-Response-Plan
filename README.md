## **High-Level Overview**

### **Objective**
To identify and prioritize cyber risks, assess vulnerabilities, and recommend actionable treatments to protect sensitive data, ensure regulatory compliance, and support operational continuity.

### **Scope**
The assessment covered:
- Cloud-hosted infrastructure (IaaS)
- End-user devices and hardware
- Business-critical applications (ERP, CRM, and productivity tools)
- Human factors influencing security

### **Methodology**
1. **Risk Assessment**: Identification of threats and vulnerabilities.
2. **Threat Analysis**: Evaluation of potential attack vectors.
3. **Controls Evaluation**: Assessment of existing security measures.
4. **Action Plan**: Development of risk treatments and recommendations.

### **Tools and Standards**
- ISO 27001 principles for risk management
- Automated and manual vulnerability scanning
- Compliance frameworks: GDPR, APP, and NDB Scheme

## **Key Findings**
- **Critical Risks**: Single points of failure in IT operations and key personnel reliance.
- **High Risks**: Email security gaps, software vulnerabilities, and insider threats.
- **Moderate Risks**: Inconsistent endpoint protection and regulatory audit gaps.

| **Risk**                           | **Likelihood** | **Consequence** | **Rating**  |
|------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Single Point of Failure (IT Ops)   | Likely         | Major            | Critical    |
| Phishing Attacks                   | Possible       | Major            | High        |
| Misconfigured Cloud Services       | Possible       | Major            | High        |
| Insider Threats                    | Possible       | Moderate         | Moderate    |

## **Lessons Learned**
1. **Proactive Planning**: Succession planning and cross-training are essential to reduce reliance on key individuals.
2. **Phishing Awareness**: Regular employee training can significantly mitigate the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks.
3. **Configuration Audits**: Regular reviews of cloud and email configurations prevent exploitable gaps.
4. **Endpoint Protection**: Consistent security policies across all devices reduce vulnerabilities in a remote-first environment.

---

## **What Went Well**
- **Collaborative Effort**: Smooth coordination between the IT team and external assessors ensured thorough analysis.
- **Quick Mitigation**: Several high-risk vulnerabilities were addressed during the assessment period.
- **Policy Framework**: Clear documentation and compliance with regulatory standards strengthened trust among stakeholders.

## **Action Plan**
### **Managerial Controls**
1. **Succession Planning**: Reduce single points of failure by training multiple employees in critical IT processes.
2. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date policies and procedures accessible to relevant personnel.

### **Technical Controls**
1. **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Secure employee devices with enforced encryption and remote wiping capabilities.
2. **Password Manager**: Implement a company-owned password manager to enforce strong, unique passwords.
3. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Monitor and respond to threats targeting employee devices.

### **Operational Controls**
1. **Threat Intelligence**: Subscribe to real-time threat feeds to stay ahead of emerging risks.
2. **Incident Playbooks**: Develop and test response playbooks for common threats like phishing and ransomware.
3. **Compliance Audits**: Regularly review regulatory compliance to mitigate legal and financial risks.
